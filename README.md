# 👋 Hi there, I’m **SaMRaT**  

🎓 *Electrical Engineering student* | 🖥️ *Simulation enthusiast* | 🎶 *Music lover (🎸 Guitar + 🎤 Vocals = my life)*

---

## 🌱 About me
- Currently pursuing **Electrical Engineering**  
- Deeply interested in **simulation**, **signal processing**, and **numerical methods**
- Learning to blend **Python** and engineering to create visual tools and educational apps  
- Fun fact: I code better when there's music playing in the background! 🎧

---

## ⚡ What I’m up to
- Working on **simulation projects** using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib  
- Exploring topics like:
  - Fourier series and transforms
  - AC circuit analysis
  - Visualizing waveforms in time & frequency domains  
- Building small tools to help students (like me!) understand engineering concepts interactively

---

## 🤝 Looking to collaborate
- Open to team up on:
  - Python simulation or visualization tools
  - Educational engineering projects
  - Anything that mixes **code, math, and creativity**  

---

## 📫 Connect with me
- Facebook: `fb` (feel free to drop a message!)
- Always happy to meet fellow learners and creators
